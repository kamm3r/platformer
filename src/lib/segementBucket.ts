/**
 * Creates a segmented bucket that can be used to render a large number of entities
 * through React more efficiently. It creates a number of sub-buckets (`segments`, default is 30)
 * that can be rendered separately. Newly added entities are distributed across these
 * buckets, with the cursor moving to the next bucket after `limit` (default 100) additions.
 *
 * This is an experimental class that will eventually migrate into Miniplex itself.
